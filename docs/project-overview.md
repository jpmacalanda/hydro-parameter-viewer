# Project Overview

The Hydroponics Monitoring System is a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing hydroponics setups. It combines hardware sensors with a modern web interface to provide real-time monitoring of crucial parameters.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of:
  - pH levels
  - Temperature
  - Water levels
  - TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)
- Web-based dashboard
- Multi-device access through WebSocket communication
- Docker support for easy deployment

## Architecture

The system consists of three main components:
1. Arduino with sensors for data collection
2. Raspberry Pi running a WebSocket server
3. Web application for data visualization
